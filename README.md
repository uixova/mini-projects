# Mini Projects

Welcome to my Mini Projects repository! 🎨

This repository is a collection of small, complete web projects showcasing my front-end design and development skills. Projects here are constantly evolving, and new ideas and themes are added regularly.

## Highlights
- Responsive websites for various industries (cafes, flower shops, personal portfolios, etc.)
- Modern layouts using Grid and Flexbox
- Interactive buttons, hover effects, and CSS animations
- Fully coded and designed by me

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Animations)
- Minimal JavaScript for interactivity

## Notes
These projects are perfect examples of my ability to design and build user-friendly websites. Each project demonstrates a unique concept or theme, and more projects will be added over time.
